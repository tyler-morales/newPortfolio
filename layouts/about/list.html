        <h2>Tyler Morales</h2>
        <p>Ever since a young age, Iâ€™ve been interested in technology and design. From growing up with the internet, building countless projects and constantly having an urge to create anything, <span class="highlight">purposeful design</span> has been important to me. Ultimately, this fascination with <span class="highlight">creativity</span> and <span class="highlight">design</span> has led me to find web development the perfect landscape to extend my passion towards building <span class="highlight">interactive</span> and <span class="highlight">intuitive web experiences</span>.</p>
        <p>Along with development, I am very active in the developer community online and in local Chicago meetups. I, amongst others, build up and motivate other like minded individuals, document our progress and learn the latest technologies with developers globally! Currently, I am studying <span class="highlight">Web Development and Design</span> at Columbia College Chicago. </p>
